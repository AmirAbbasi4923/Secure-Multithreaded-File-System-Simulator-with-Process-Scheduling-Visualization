# Secure-Multithreaded-File-System-Simulator-with-Process-Scheduling-Visualization
A secure, multithreaded Java-based file system simulator featuring password-protected file management, real-time disk usage monitoring, and visual CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS and Round Robin) using a modern Swing GUI.


** Overview**
This project simulates a real-world Operating System by implementing:

Secure File System Management

Multithreaded operations

Disk Usage Monitoring

Process Scheduling simulations (FCFS and Round Robin)

A modern Java Swing GUI with Dark Mode

It bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and practical learning of OS core functionalities


**Features**
📁 Create, Read, Delete, Copy, and Move files and folders.

🔒 Optional Password Protection for sensitive files.

📊 Live Disk Usage Monitoring (auto-refresh every few seconds).

🧵 Multithreaded file operations (background tasks to keep GUI smooth).

🛡️ Synchronized access to file system to ensure thread safety.

🛠️ Process Scheduling Algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS) with Gantt Chart

Round Robin (RR) with Quantum Timeline Visualization

💾 Data Persistence through Serialization — File system state is saved automatically.

🌙 Full Dark Mode GUI for modern and clean design.

** Project Goals**

Enhance understanding of File System Management and CPU Scheduling.

Provide a simulation close to real-world OS functionality.

Improve hands-on skills with Java, Swing, Multithreading, and Synchronization.

Support SDG 4 (Quality Education) by creating a practical educational to
